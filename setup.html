        <h5>Setup</h5>
        <h6>Dealing</h6>
        <p>
          Once the game begins, each player is designated a name (Player 1, 
          Player 2, etc.…) and the dealer order is established (Player 1 
          deals the first hand, Player 2 deals the second, and so on and so forth). 
          The dealer taps on the deck to deal, and one chip from each player is 
          added to the pot as their ante. The dealer shows the device to each 
          player starting with the player on their left and ending on themselves. 
          Each player taps on the Deal Card button to draw their first card and 
          the process repeats until everyone has drawn a second card. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h6>Playing the Hand</h6>
        <p>
          The dealer shows each player the cards they have drawn again and this time 
          the player may place a bet from one chip to their remaining chips. 
          <em>Players may bet the entire pot even if they don't have enough chips to cover, 
          but if they lose they will be on the hook for any debts they incur...please 
          bet responsibly.</em> After betting, the third card is dealt to determine if 
          the player has won or lost. 
        </p>
        <h6>Winning and Losing</h6>
        <p>
          If the card value is between the player’s two cards, the player wins and 
          recoups their bet plus an equal amount from the pot. If the third card is 
          outside the values of the player’s cards or is of the same value as either of 
          them, the player loses their bet which is added to the pot. If the player’s 
          two cards are of consecutive values, the player automatically loses, and no 
          third card is dealt. If the player’s two cards are the same, the player wins 
          two chips and, again, no third card is dealt. 

          The game ends when the end game condition is met. When the game ends, the 
          winner(s) and losers are listed with their remaining chips and winnings.
